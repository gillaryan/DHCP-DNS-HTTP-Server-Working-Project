# ::Server Configuration with Packet Tracer::

In this Packet Tracer project, I designed a network to showcase the essential roles of key servers in managing network services. The setup includes a DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment, a DNS server for domain name resolution, and an HTTP server for handling web requests. This configuration highlights how these servers interact to support dynamic networking, user-friendly access, and web-based functionalities.

DHCP Server:

Purpose:  Automatically assigns IP addresses to client machines.

Benefits:  Streamlines network management by eliminating the need for manual IP configuration and preventing IP conflicts.

Keywords:  Dynamic IP Allocation, IP Management, Network Efficiency.


DNS Server:

Purpose:  Translates domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.

Benefits:  Enhances user experience by allowing easy access to resources using human-readable domain names rather than numerical IP addresses.

Keywords:  Domain Name Resolution, DNS Lookup, IP Address Mapping.


HTTP Server:

Purpose:  Processes and responds to web requests from clients on the World Wide Web (WWW).

Benefits:  Enables web browsing and interaction with web-based applications by serving web content and handling client requests.

Keywords:  Web Hosting, HTTP Requests, Content Delivery.

---This project demonstrates the integration and functionality of these critical network services, providing a comprehensive solution for a robust and efficient network environment.---
